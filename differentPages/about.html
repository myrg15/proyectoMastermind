        <div class="title-mastermind">Master Mind</div>
        <div class="text-description">Logic game can be played by two people. It helps to develop certain skills in 
        the logical-mathematical area. 
        </div>
        <br>
        <div class="title-objective">Objective</div>
        <div class="text-description-decipher">Decipher the color code
            Ruling out possibilities according to clues provided by the opponent
        </div>
        <br>
        <div class="step-1">Step 1: Choose the code</div>
        <div class="text-description-decipher">The coder will create a four-piece code. You can create any combination of colors,
        even repeating the same color several times. 
        </div>
        <br>
        <div class="step-2">First attempt at decoding</div>
        <div class="text-description-decipher">Four pieces should be placed in the first row. This is the one furthest away from the space where the code is placed. The coder must give clues to the decoder. To do so, it will place a white piece for each piece in the correct place and a red or black piece for each piece in the place and color indicated.
         In this example, the yellow piece is in the correct place so a red piece is placed. All the other pieces are incorrect so the space is left blank.
        </div>
        <br>
        <div class="step-3">Use the clues</div>
        <div class="text-description-decipher">The decoder will use the hint to change his move. The information he has at hand is that one 
            of the pieces is placed correctly so he must try to determine which one it is. The best way is to change one piece at a time. In the example the white piece was swapped for a pink piece so now the coder must give new clues. In this case there are two pieces in place and of the correct color: the yellow and the pink.
        </div>
        <br>
        <div class="step-4">Eliminating possibilities</div>
        <div class="text-description-decipher">In this case the decoder decides to put the pieces back in their previous position and change one of the other pieces. It already knows that the pink piece is correct because when it placed it in this position it received a red piece.
            By making this change again it gets two red pieces so this means that the green piece is not in the code.
